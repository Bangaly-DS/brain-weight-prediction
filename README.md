# brain-weight-prediction
Built a Linear Regression model to predict brain weight based on head size using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, achieving 76% accuracy.
# ðŸ§  Brain Weight Prediction  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project applies **Linear Regression** to predict **brain weight** based on **head size**.  
The goal was to explore the relationship between these variables and build a predictive model.  

## ðŸ›  Tools Used  
- **Python** (for data analysis & modeling)  
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for visualization)  
- **Scikit-learn** (for building and evaluating the model)  

## ðŸ“Š Key Results  
âœ… Data preprocessing and visualization revealed a strong correlation between head size and brain weight.  
âœ… The **Linear Regression model achieved 76% accuracy** in predicting brain weight.  
âœ… Demonstrated how simple regression can model biological relationships.
